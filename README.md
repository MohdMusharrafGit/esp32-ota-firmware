🚀 ESP32 HTTPS OTA Updater

A lightweight project that enables secure Over-The-Air (OTA) firmware updates for the ESP32 using HTTPS directly from GitHub.

⚙️ Features

🔒 Secure HTTPS firmware download

🔄 Auto version check and update

💡 Easy setup with Arduino IDE

🧠 No manual flashing required

🧩 How It Works

ESP32 connects to Wi-Fi → checks GitHub version.txt → downloads firmware.bin if a new version is available → flashes and reboots automatically.

📁 Files

main.ino – main source code

firmware.bin – compiled binary

version.txt – stores firmware version
